<p>A reasonable definition of a software framework is <a class="reference internal" href="#wiki-framework" id="id1"><span>[Wiki-Framework]</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The framework orchestrates data flow, resource management, and parallel execution.
It enables a scientific collaboration to write standardized workflows where physicists can insert their own algorithms.
In a HEP context, this insertion often occurs by the framework dynamically loading libraries called <em>plugins</em>.
Although not required, a framework often provides a program’s <cite>main(…)</cite> function, which (directly or indirectly) invokes user code within the plugins as configured at appropriate points in the program’s execution.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates three high-level computing stages commonly used in HEP to obtain physics results from detector signals.</p>

<p>Frameworks are typically used in a high-level trigger environment, for reconstructing physics objects from detector signals, or for simulating physics processes.
Many analysis needs can also be met by a data-processing framework.
However, the HEP community tends to perform final-stage analysis using standalone applications.
Phlex, therefore, aims to satisfy the data-processing needs of only physics reconstruction and simulation.</p>
<section id="requirements-process-and-framework-selection">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Requirements Process and Framework Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-process-and-framework-selection" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Phlex provides facilities and behaviors that support the physics goals of its stakeholders, notably the DUNE experiment <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f1" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.
In a concerted effort in 2023 and 2024, DUNE established a set of high-level requirements or <em>stakeholder requirements</em>, which constrain the design of a framework in support of DUNE’s needs.
A dedicated tool <a class="reference internal" href="#jama-connect" id="id3"><span>[Jama-Connect]</span></a> was subsequently selected to manage such stakeholder requirements, tracking them in a version-controlled manner, and creating logical dependencies among them.
Additionally, <em>system requirements</em> were created to guide implementation in support of the stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p>After formulating its stakeholder requirements, DUNE evaluated whether existing HEP frameworks could also satisfy DUNE’s needs.
The frameworks considered included the <em>Gaudi</em> framework <a class="reference internal" href="#gaudi" id="id4"><span>[Gaudi]</span></a> (used by ATLAS and LHCb), <em>CMSSW</em>’s framework <a class="reference internal" href="#cmssw" id="id5"><span>[CMSSW]</span></a>, ALICE’s <em>O2</em> framework <a class="reference internal" href="#o2" id="id6"><span>[O2]</span></a>, as well as the <em>art</em> framework <a class="reference internal" href="#art" id="id7"><span>[art]</span></a>, which is used by many of the intensity-frontier experiments at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
Over time, each framework has undergone substantial adjustments to take advantage of hardware and software developments (multi-threading, multi-processing, GPU usage, etc.), resulting in more efficient data-processing, and (in some cases) making possible some data-processing that may have been infeasible without adjustment.</p>
<p>Each framework considered above, however, is designed according to event-centric, collider-physics concepts.
The DUNE stakeholder requirements demand that any event-centric assumptions must be relaxed to permit more flexible data organizations (see <a class="reference internal" href="#flexibility"><span class="std std-numref">Section 1.2.1</span></a>).
Specifically, the data groupings of interest must not be rigidly defined by the framework itself, but specifiable by the user <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 22" title="DUNE 22"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 22]</em></a>.
Even <em>art</em>, the framework used by the ProtoDUNE experiments, forces users to adopt awkward workarounds to process the relatively slow-evolving detector signatures of neutrino interactions (as compared to the very fast beam interactions of collider experiments).</p>
<p>To be sure, an existing HEP framework can be modified to eventually meet the needs of DUNE.
However, such modification does not exist in a vacuum, and in DUNE’s determination, adjusting an existing HEP framework to satisfy DUNE’s stakeholder requirements was impractical.
Significant changes would be required for any of the frameworks, and it is unclear the manner and extent to which such changes would be accepted by already operational experiments using the framework in question.
DUNE thus decided to develop a new framework designed to directly support DUNE’s framework requirements.
Establishing a new framework also provides an opportunity to shed legacy coding patterns that have been problematic in achieving efficient data-processing.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Requirements Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-ownership" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each Phlex stakeholder owns its stakeholder requirements, which support the high-level needs of the experiment.
System requirements, which are subservient to stakeholder requirements, are owned by the Phlex developers, who are free to adjust the implementation to satisfy all stakeholder requirements.</p>

<section id="framework-philosophy">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Framework Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#framework-philosophy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A framework is a tool that aids the scientific process of inferring accurate physics results from observed data.
Maintaining data integrity is therefore paramount, as is retaining an accounting of how physics results were obtained from that data.
The Phlex design therefore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>treats all data presented to (or created by) Phlex as immutable for the remainder of a Phlex program’s execution,</p></li>
<li><p>requires recording the <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/glossary.html#term-Provenance"><span class="xref std std-term">provenance</span></a> of every created <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/glossary.html#term-Concrete-data-product"><span class="xref std std-term">concrete data product</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 121" title="DUNE 121"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 121]</em></a>, and</p></li>
<li><p>enables, and—to the extent possible—ensures the <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/glossary.html#term-Reproducible"><span class="xref std std-term">reproducible</span></a> creation of data products.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="flexibility">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Flexibility<a class="headerlink" href="#flexibility" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Physics results in HEP are obtained by processing large collections of data and making statistical statements from them.
Each element of a collection generally contains the data corresponding to one readout of the detector.
Such elements are often termed “events”, which are treated as statistically independent observations of physics processes.
It is common for experiments to define larger aggregations of data by grouping events into subruns (or, for LHC experiments, luminosity blocks), and by further grouping subruns into runs.
These larger aggregations are typically defined according to when certain detector calibrations or accelerator beam parameters were applied.</p>
<p>Although frameworks supporting the <cite>Run</cite>-<cite>Subrun</cite>-<cite>Event</cite> (RSE) hierarchy have proved effective and flexible enough for collider-based experiments, the RSE hierarchy is not always appropriate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>simulated data often do not need to be processed with an RSE hierarchy; a flat hierarchy (e.g. only the “event”) is usually sufficient,</p></li>
<li><p>framework interface is often explicitly couched in RSE terminology, making it difficult to apply to non-collider contexts, where a different data-grouping may be more appropriate (e.g. time slices for extended readout windows, each of which correspond to one “event”),</p></li>
<li><p>calibration data is often described independently from an RSE hierarchy, requiring other means of accounting for systematic corrections that must be applied to the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Phlex does not prescribe an RSE hierarchy—it only requires that the hierarchy be representable as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) at run-time, with each grouping of data represented as a node in the graph, and the relationships between data-groupings represented as edges.
This expression of the hierarchy greatly relaxes the constraints placed on experiments while still supporting the collider-based RSE hierarchy (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch_conceptual_design/data_organization.html#data-layers-data-cells-and-families"><span class="std std-numref">Section 3.2.2</span></a>).</p>
<p>The hierarchy graph and its nodes (i.e. the data-groupings) are definable at run-time, thus allowing the specification of data organizations that are appropriate for the workflow <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 22" title="DUNE 22"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 22]</em></a>.</p>
<p>The flexibility in defining data-groupings and how they relate to each other necessitates further flexibility:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>user-defined algorithms are not bound to statically-typed classes representing data-groupings—e.g. there is no direct dependency on a C++ “event” class, and</p></li>
<li><p>a framework program must be “driven” by a user-provided entity that expresses the hierarchy graph desired by the user, not a hierarchy that is prescribed by the framework.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These concepts are discussed more fully in <a class="reference internal" href="conceptual_design.html#conceptual-design"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 3</span></a>.</p>

This means the framework:</p>

<section id="usability">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Usability<a class="headerlink" href="#usability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although usability is not a formal stakeholder requirement, physicists expect various behaviors and features that ease one’s interaction with a data-processing framework.
Phlex strives to meet this expectation in various ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt><em>minimizing boilerplate code</em></dt><dd><p>Some data-processing frameworks in HEP adopt an object-oriented design, where stateful framework-dependent objects are required to register inherently framework-agnostic algorithms with a framework program.
Phlex does not generally require physics algorithms to depend on any framework libraries <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 43" title="DUNE 43"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 43]</em></a>.
This design, therefore, substantially reduces the amount of code required for the interface between physics algorithms and the framework itself (see <a class="reference internal" href="#framework-independence"><span class="std std-numref">Section 1.4</span></a>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>failing early</em></dt><dd><p>To avoid needless computation, Phlex will fail as early as possible in the presence of an error.
This means that, for C++ usage, compile-time failures will be favored over run-time exceptions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>meaningful error messages</em></dt><dd><p>When failures within the scope of the framework occur <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#errors" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, the reported error messages will be as descriptive as possible.
Messages will typically include diagnostic information about the data being processed when the error occurred as well as the algorithms that were executed on that data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>graceful shutdown</em></dt><dd><p>For run-time errors, the default behavior of Phlex is to end the framework program gracefully <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 134" title="DUNE 134"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 134]</em></a>.
A graceful shutdown refers to a framework program that completes the processing of all in-flight data, safely closes all open input and output files, cleans up connections to external entities (such as databases), etc. before the program ends.
This ensures that no resources are left in ill-defined states and that all output files are readable and valid.</p>

<section id="reusability">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.4. </span>Reusability<a class="headerlink" href="#reusability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The decision to create a new framework is appropriately met with skepticism.
However, the selection of which framework design to pursue was strongly guided by past R&amp;D efforts specifically targeted to explore DUNE’s framework needs <a class="reference internal" href="#meld" id="id9"><span>[Meld]</span></a>.
In addition, many ideas already represented in existing production-quality frameworks are also integrated into Phlex’s technical design (<em>under preparation</em>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Existing parallel-processing libraries will be used (e.g. Intel’s oneTBB),</p></li>
<li><p>ROOT IO mechanisms will be in place for persisting data,</p></li>
<li><p>The HEP-CCE experience on portability technologies will inform how CPU/GPU source-code portability is achieved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The chance to develop a new framework also necessitates a re-examination of the knowledge acquired by the broader computing community, and how that knowledge can be applied to data-processing in HEP.
Consequently, part of the Phlex design is simply a summary of prior research that has a ready application to DUNE’s data-processing needs (e.g. see <a class="reference internal" href="preliminaries.html#high-level-abstractions"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 2</span></a>).</p>

</section>
<section id="framework-independence">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>Framework Independence<a class="headerlink" href="#framework-independence" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We define an algorithm as <em>framework-independent</em> if it contains no explicit dependencies on framework libraries—i.e. it is possible to build and execute the algorithm independent of a framework context.
For framework-independent C++ algorithms, this means there are no direct or transitive framework libraries that are either included as headers in the algorithm code or linked as run-time libraries.
Similarly, framework-independent Python algorithms import no direct or transitive framework packages.</p>
<p>Phlex is required to support the registration of user-defined, framework-independent algorithms <a class="reference internal" href="appendices/requirements.html#DUNE 43" title="DUNE 43"><em class="xref need">[DUNE 43]</em></a>.
This does not mean that <em>all</em> framework-independent algorithms are suitable for registration, nor does it mean that all algorithms registered with the framework must be framework-independent.
In fact, depending on what the algorithm is doing, some algorithms might require explicit framework dependencies.</p>
