Supported Platforms
===================

Phlex must support the platforms that are required by its stakeholders.
As of this writing, Phlex programs must run on the AlmaLinux 9 operating system, which is used for DUNE's batch-processing needs.

Where practicable, Phlex may be usable on other systems, such as Ubuntu and macOS.
However, any platforms not required by Phlex's stakeholders (or *non-essential* platforms) will be supported on a best-effort basis.
In addition, the set of supportable non-essential platforms is constrained by the libraries required by Phlex and the available compute nodes provided by continuous integration systems.
