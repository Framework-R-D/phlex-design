    Algorithm
        A user-defined function registered for execution by the framework.
        Algorithms often serve as operators in a higher-order function.

    Algorithmic origin
        The unique identifier, version, and configuration of the algorithm responsible for the creation of a specific data product.

    Ancestral data
        The data used as input to the algorithm that produced the data at issue.

    APA
        Anode Plane Assembly: physical far-detector unit comprising thousands of wires as a planar slice

    Backward compatibility (persisted data)
        The ability to construct the in-memory representation of data from persisted information derived from an earlier in-memory representation of those data.

    CRP
        Charge Readout Plane: physical far-detector unit placed on either the top or bottom edge of an APA

    Configuration canonical form
        The result of a transformation on a configuration that preserves the semantics of the configuration.
        All semantically identical configurations shall have the same canonical form.
        Any given configuration shall have exactly one canonical form (which may be syntactically identical to the original configuration).

    Configured higher-order function (CHOF)
        An entity created when registering an algorithm with the framework.
        The registration includes the algorithm's input/output data product requirements, the algorithm's resource requirements, and the higher-order function to which the algorithm serves as an operator.

    Data layer
        A label that denotes a group of data cells which are all of the same type.

        A label is one node in a data layer hierarchy.
        The top layer of the graph is always the *Job*.
        All other layers are defined by the combination of the configuration of the framework job and the layers defined in the input data.

    Data layer hierarchy
        A hierarchy of data layers.

        A data layer hierarchy is an acyclic graph of relationships of logical containment.
        The top layer of the hierarchy is always the *Job*.
        All other layers in the hierarchy are defined by the combination of the configuration of the framework job and the layers defined in the input data.

    Data model
        A set of mechanisms enabling the definition, creation, identification, and organization of data products, as well as the relationships among them.
        The data model also specifies the mechanism for reading and writing persistable data products.

    Data product
        An object managed by the framework and for which provenance information is recorded.

        A data product is produced by an algorithm (or is recovered from storage by a provider) and can be passed as an input to other algorithms.
        Data products determine the flow of execution of the graph of CHOFs configured in a framework program.

    Data cell [#data-set]_
        A grouping of data products that is identifiable by the framework.

        All the data cells of a given data layer are identifiable by the same type of index, and each is identified by a unique index value.
        In *art*, individual *Run* objects, *SubRun* objects and *Event* objects are examples of data cells.

    Deterministic
        Identical inputs produce identical results via identical behavior.

    Framework ecosystem
        Ensemble of software delivered with the application framework.

    Index set
        A mathematical set used to identify elements of an indexed familyâ€”e.g. in the expression :math:`[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] = \family{a}`, the index set :math:`\isetdefault` is the set :math:`\{1,\ 2,\ \dots,\ n\}`.

    Indexed family
        A collection of elements identified by an index from an index set.

        The term family is often used as a shorthand for indexed family.
        In *art* there was no direct representation of families.
        However, the sequence of *Events* processed by a given job is an example of a family of data cells.
        In a single *art* module, the sequence of event data products looked up by the module across all events is an example of a family of data products.
    

    Integration test
        A test that verifies the behavior of multiple system components working in concert.

    Metadata
        Data that is ancillary to physics data.

    Module
        A compiled library that is dynamically loadable by the framework.

    Parentage
        The set of unique identifiers of each ancestral datum.

    Persistable data product
        A data product that can be read from and written to persistent storage.

    Provenance
        A description of how the data at issue were produced (parentage, configuration, library versions, and other information as specified by requirements).

    Reproducible
        Identical inputs produce identical results.

    Resource
        A non-data software or hardware component managed by the program that can be required by algorithms.

        Examples include:

        - CPU cores
        - CPU memory
        - GPUs
        - Network
        - Thread-unsafe utilities
        - Inference servers
        - Databases

    Unit test
        A test that verifies the behavior of a small and self-contained system component in isolation from other system components.

    Validation
        Did it do what we needed it to do (requirements)

    Verification
        Did it do what we intended it to do (code)
