Sequences and Families
**********************

A finite sequence can be represented as an ordered list of objects, all of which are from the same set or *type* (see :numref:`ch_preliminaries/types:Types`).
For example, the sequence :math:`a = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]` is written as

.. math::
    a = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] = [a_i]_{i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}} = \family{a}

where each :math:`a_i \in A`, and :math:`\mathcal{I} = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}` is the :term:`index set` whose elements are used to identify objects within the sequence :math:`a`.

The elements :math:`a_i` can be ordered only if the index set itself is ordered [#strict]_â€”e.g because the elements of the set :math:`\mathbb{N}` respect the order :math:`1 \lt 2 \lt 3 \lt \cdots` , the elements of :math:`a` are listed in that order, and :math:`a` is, therefore, a sequence.
However, if the index set has no ordering associated with it, then instead of :math:`a` representing a sequence, it represents an :term:`indexed family`, where the ordering of elements is not meaningful.
Specifically, an indexed family :math:`b` can be equivalently represented as:

.. math::
    b = [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n] = [b_n, \dots, b_2, b_1] = \family{b}

or any of the :math:`n!` orderings possible.
The index set :math:`\isetdefault` simply provides a mapping from an index to the data object itself.

   The order in which elements are presented to algorithms is not guaranteed in concurrent contexts.
   Phlex, therefore, processes indexed families of data and not sequences.

The *length* of the family :math:`b` above is denoted by :math:`|b|`, and it equals the *cardinality* of the index set: :math:`|b| = |\isetdefault|`.
In this document, we also use the *empty family*, which has length 0, and whose elements can be indexed by the empty set:

.. math::
    [\ ] = [b_i]_{i \in \emptyset} \ .

We also use the notation :math:`\tilde{b}` to denote a sequence whose elements are either Boolean `true` (:math:`\textsf{T}`) or `false` (:math:`\textsf{F}`), such as :math:`\tilde{b} = [\textsf{T}, \textsf{T}, \textsf{F}, \dots]`.
