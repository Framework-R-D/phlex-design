Data flow
=========

In :numref:`functional_programming:Functional programming`, the example was given for creating tracks from wires.
The simplified expression for doing this was the chained application of two functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` such that:

.. math::
   ts = g\ (f\ ws) = (g \comp f)\ ws

where :math:`ws` and :math:`ts` are the wires and tracks, respectively.

An alternative representation to the equational form is a *directed graph*

.. graphviz:: graphviz/functional-programming-data-flow.gv
   :align: center

where the functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` are vertices or *nodes* and the data :math:`ws` and :math:`ts` are passed along arrows or *edges* that connect the nodes [#f1]_.
The arrows indicate the flow of the data (or *data flow*) through the graph.

Some observations:

- The function :math:`f` returns hits that are unlabeled in the equational form.
  For the graph above, we explicitly label those hits as :math:`hs` to emphasize that data are always passed along edges.
  If, however, the hits are not needed by any other function in the graph, the two functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` can be replaced by their composition :math:`h=g \circ f`

  .. graphviz:: graphviz/functional-programming-data-flow-optimized.gv
     :align: center

  resulting in potential performance improvements in computational efficiency and program memory usage.

- A directed graph can have no unterminated edges---i.e. an edge must have a source (the tail of the arrow) and a target (the head of the arrow).
  This means that whereas the equation does not need to specify where the :math:`ws` wires originate (or where the :math:`ts` tracks end up), such locations must be specified in the graph.
  Any node that has only outgoing edges is called a *source* (denoted by a solid dot), and any node that has only incoming edges is a *sink* (denoted by an encircled solid dot).

Data flow with sequences
------------------------

As mentioned earlier in :numref:`functional_programming:Sequences of data and higher-order functions`, processing sequences of data is a critical aspect of obtaining physics results.
The data-flow discussion in the previous section naturally maps to applying the functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` to elements of sequences.  Specifically [#f2]_:

- Instead of the individual objects :math:`ws`, :math:`hs`, and :math:`ts` being passed along the edges, the sequences :math:`[ws_i]`, :math:`[hs_i]`, and :math:`[ts_i]` are passed.
- The functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` map to :math:`\transform{f}` and :math:`\transform{g}`, respectively.

.. graphviz:: graphviz/functional-programming-data-flow-hof.gv
   :align: center

The above graph does not specify an implementation---assuming :math:`f` and :math:`g` are pure functions (see :numref:`functional_programming:Pure functions`), the same result is obtained if (a) full sequences are passed between the nodes, or (b) one element per sequence is passed at a time.
Whether option (a) or (b) is chosen as the processing implementation depends on the data and the overall constraints on the program.

   Is this decided by the framework itself, by user code or by configuration?

One benefit to using a graph representation using data sequences and higher-order functions is the ability to easily express folds and unfolds.
As an illustration, consider the calculation of a sum of squares for all integers from 1 through :math:`n`:

.. math::
   S(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n i^2

This calculation requires three separate steps:

1. an unfold called *iota* that, given an integer :math:`n`, generates a sequence of integers from 1 through :math:`n`,
2. a transformation called *square* that squares each integer in the sequence, and
3. a fold called *sum* that sums all squared integers.

The data-flow graph of individual objects looks like:

.. graphviz:: graphviz/unfold-transform-fold.gv
   :align: center

where each number is passed along its own edge to the nodes performing the calculation.
By adopting a sequence-based representation of the sum-of-squares problem, the data-flow graph is considerably simplified:

.. graphviz:: graphviz/unfold-transform-fold-hof.gv
   :align: center

In addition, the topology of the sequence-based graph remains the same regardless of the value of :math:`n`; the topology of the object-based graph becomes intractable as :math:`n` increases.

The vast majority of graphs included in this design document adopt the sequence-based data-flow representation.

.. [#f1] Treating functions as nodes and data as edges is a function-centric view of the graph.
         It is also possible to invert the view of the graph such that the data are treated as nodes and the functions as edges; this is the data-centric graph, which is the *line digraph* of the function-centric graph.
.. [#f2] In Haskell (and, correspondingly, in category theory), this transformation is achieved through the `List` functor.
