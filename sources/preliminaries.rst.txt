Phlex adopts a *functional programming* paradigm, which is heavily influenced by mathematics.
To adequately describe what functional programming is, we first introduce function notation, the concept of the *type*, and mathematical sequences and indexed families.
With these ingredients, we are then able to discuss functional programming and how it is supported by data-flow graphs.
